# Comprehend Pipeline üöö
This project is a serverless data processing pipeline built on AWS using Terraform. It performs natural language processing and analysis on text files uploaded to an S3 bucket, exposing various insights provided by the AWS Comprehend API.

## Overview
The pipeline consists of the following components:

1. **S3 Bucket**: A designated S3 bucket with a `/text/` partition for storing the input text files, providing a secure and scalable repository for user submissions.
2. **S3 Notification**: When a new file is uploaded to the `/text/` partition, an S3 notification is triggered, initiating the text analysis journey.
3. **SQS Queue**: The S3 notification sends a message to an SQS queue, ensuring efficient and reliable message delivery.
4. **Step Function (Comprehend)**: The SQS queue triggers the first Step Function, orchestrating the initial text processing workflow.
5. **AWS Comprehend**: The Step Function invokes AWS Comprehend, leveraging its advanced natural language processing capabilities to extract valuable insights from the text. This includes language detection, entity recognition, key phrase extraction, personally identifiable information (PII) detection, sentiment analysis, syntax analysis, targeted sentiment analysis, and toxic content detection.
6. **S3 Output**: The analysis results are securely stored in an S3 bucket under the `/comprehend/` partition, ensuring easy access and retrieval.
7. **S3 Notification**: When a new file is written to the `/comprehend/` partition, another S3 notification is triggered, initiating the next phase of the pipeline.
8. **SQS Queue**: The S3 notification sends a message to a second SQS queue, facilitating seamless communication between pipeline stages.
9. **Step Function (Datalake)**: The second SQS queue triggers the second Step Function, responsible for organizing and partitioning the Comprehend analysis results.
10. **S3 Output**: The partitioned data is stored in the S3 bucket under the `/datalake/comprehend` partition, creating a structured and accessible data lake for further analysis and exploration.

## State Machines
Below is an explaination of the state machines that perform the main work of the orchestration.

1. **Retrieve Notification**: It retrieves a notification from SQS, which is routed via AWS EventBridge, indicating that a new file has been uploaded to the S3 bucket.
2. **Retrieve File**: It fetches the uploaded file from the specified location in the S3 bucket.
3. **Detect Language**: It utilizes AWS Comprehend to detect the language of the document, determining its primary language.
4. **Text Analysis**: It fans out using all available AWS Comprehend endpoints (excluding medical) to perform various text analysis tasks on the document. These tasks may include entity recognition, key phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, syntax analysis, and toxic content detection.
5. **Normalize Data**: It normalizes the data obtained from each Comprehend endpoint, ensuring consistency and uniformity in the format of the analysis results.
6. **Combine Data**: It combines the original event data with the analyzed data from AWS Comprehend, creating a comprehensive dataset containing both the original document information and the insights extracted from it.
7. **Store in S3**: It stores the combined data in the designated "comprehend" folder within the same S3 bucket, making it easily accessible for further analysis or retrieval.


### S3ObjectCreatedComprehend
<img alt="S3ObjectCreatedComprehend State Machine" src="./img/png/stepfunctions_graph_s3_object_created_text.png" style="display:block;height:auto;width:100%" />

1. **Receive Notification**: It receives a notification indicating the availability of a new Comprehend document, which was created by the previous state machine.
2. **Retrieve Document**: It retrieves the newly created Comprehend document from the specified location in the S3 bucket.
3. **Explode Records**: It breaks down the Comprehend records into individual data types, such as entities, key phrases, sentiment analysis, etc.
4. **Normalize Keys**: It normalizes the keys within each record, ensuring consistency and uniformity in the naming conventions.
5. **Write Data to S3**: It writes the exploded and normalized data into logical partitions in the S3 bucket. The data is organized by data model, language, and relevant attributes of the data model itself, facilitating efficient storage and retrieval.
